<h1 align="center">Hi! Welcome to My GitHub CV. I'm Cris:</h1>                                                                                                                         


An [experienced professional](#experience) looking for my first role in software development having successfully completed a highly selective Software Development bootcamp with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

Software engineering combines my passion for using logic to solve complex problems and my love for innovation. Technology has always been an interest due to its constantly changing nature which gives opportunities for continuous learning and development.

Looking forward to combining both technical and non-technical aspects of my experience in order to deliver new and exciting products within a motivated and goal-driven team.

• Issues and last-minute changes were inevitable in the day-to-day operation, so I needed to always be *quick to welcome change, adapt and make the necessary adjustments*.
